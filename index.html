    <h2>Toronto Eaton Centre</h2>
    <p>
      Toronto Eaton Centre is one of the biggest and best looking malls I have
      ever been to in all my life. The Eaton Centre is a shopping mall and
      office complex in Toronto, Ontario, I recently visited it with my family
      this summer and loved every bit of it.

    <h2>My Favourite Album</h2>
    <p>
      I have many different music artists and genres I listen to, but my
      favourite of all time has to be To Pimp A Butterfly by Kendrick Lamar. The
      contrast and relationship with jazz and rap in the music is really well
      mixed in each song.
